# The Dual-Crypt Project: A Complete Cryptography & Serialization System

## What is Dual-Crypt?

Dual-Crypt is a comprehensive **Spring Boot application** that demonstrates both **cryptographic security** and **data serialization performance**. It's actually two systems in one:

1. **üîê Cryptography System:** Provides both symmetric and asymmetric encryption services
2. **üìä Serialization Benchmarking System:** Tests and compares different data serialization formats for performance

Think of it as a **crypto security toolkit** combined with a **performance testing laboratory** - all wrapped up in a modern web application with a sleek React frontend.

## Available API Endpoints

The application provides two main sets of APIs:

### üîí Cryptography APIs

**Base URL:** `/api/asymmetric`

- **`GET /generate`** - Generate a new RSA key pair (2048-bit) with salt
  ```json
  Response: {
    "publicKeyB64": "base64-encoded-public-key",
    "privateKeyB64": "base64-encoded-private-key", 
    "saltB64": "base64-encoded-salt"
  }
  ```

- **`POST /encrypt`** - Encrypt data with RSA public key
  ```json
  Request: {
    "plaintext": "Hello, World!",
    "publicKeyB64": "your-public-key-here"
  }
  Response: {
    "text": "base64-encrypted-data"
  }
  ```

- **`POST /decrypt`** - Decrypt data with RSA private key
  ```json
  Request: {
    "cipherB64": "encrypted-data-here",
    "privateKeyB64": "your-private-key-here"
  }
  Response: {
    "text": "Hello, World!"
  }
  ```

#### Symmetric Encryption (AES)
**Base URL:** `/api/symmetric`

- **`GET /generate`** - Generate a new AES secret key and salt
  ```json
  Response: {
    "secretB64": "base64-encoded-256-bit-key",
    "saltB64": "base64-encoded-salt"
  }
  ```

- **`POST /encrypt`** - Encrypt data with AES-GCM
  ```json
  Request: {
    "plaintext": "Hello, World!",
    "secretB64": "your-secret-key-here",
    "saltB64": "your-salt-here"
  }
  Response: {
    "ivB64": "base64-initialization-vector",
    "cipherB64": "base64-encrypted-data"
  }
  ```

- **`POST /decrypt`** - Decrypt AES-GCM data
  ```json
  Request: {
    "ivB64": "initialization-vector-here",
    "cipherB64": "encrypted-data-here",
    "secretB64": "your-secret-key-here",
    "saltB64": "your-salt-here"
  }
  Response: {
    "text": "Hello, World!"
  }
  ```

### üìä Serialization Performance APIs

#### Product Generation & Testing
**Base URL:** `/api/products`

- **`GET /products?count=100`** - Generate test data in various formats
  - **Formats supported:** JSON, MessagePack, CBOR, Protocol Buffers
  - **Content-Type header** determines the format:
    - `application/json` ‚Üí JSON format
    - `application/x-msgpack` ‚Üí MessagePack format  
    - `application/cbor` ‚Üí CBOR format
    - `application/x-protobuf` ‚Üí Protocol Buffers format

- **Response includes timing headers:**
  - `X-Server-Serialize-Time-Ms` - Time spent serializing on server
  - `X-Server-Total-Time-Ms` - Total server processing time
